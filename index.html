              <hr>
          <p class="text">
            The Canadian broadband data is drawn from Canadian government website, which is a collection of 
                information related to the availability and quality of broadband internet services
                 in Canada. The data includes details on broadband speeds, technologies, and 
                 service providers, as well as geographic coverage maps for different regions 
                 of the country. The information is aimed at helping policymakers, industry 
                 stakeholders, and the general public to better understand the state of broadband 
                 connectivity in Canada and identify areas for improvement.

        <p class="text">
          <h3>1. Internet Usage in Canada
          </h3>
          <h4>1) Regional and Age Group Differences</h4>
          In 2020, 92.3% of Canadians aged 15 years and over used the internet from
any location for personal purposes. The highest rates of personal internet use were reported in Alberta (95.2%) and British Columbia (94.2%),
while the lowest rates were reported in Quebec (87.1%) and Newfoundland and Labrador (89.8%). When examining personal internet use by age
group, the highest rates of internet use were among individuals aged 15-
44, with 98.2% of individuals aged 15-24, 97.1% of individuals aged 25-34,
and 94.3% of individuals aged 35-44 reporting personal internet use. The
rates of personal internet use decreased with increasing age, with 81.2%
of individuals aged 65 and over reporting personal internet use (Statistics
Canada, 2021).

            <h3>2. Intensity of Internet, Video Streaming, and Video
              Gaming Services Use
            </h3>
            <h4>1) Age Groups and Education Levels</h4>
            The data from the Canadian Internet Use Survey in 2020 suggests that
the intensity of use of internet, video streaming services, and video gaming
services varied across age groups and education levels among individuals
aged 15 years or over in Canada (Statistics Canada, 2021). Younger age
groups and individuals with higher education levels tend to use these services more frequently compared to older age groups and those with lower
education levels. Additionally, individuals who spent 20 hours or more per
week on the internet, video streaming services, or video gaming services
may be at increased risk for negative effects such as addiction, decreased
social interaction, and decreased physical activity.

<h4>2) Implications for Policymakers and Educators</h4>
These findings highlight the importance of promoting digital literacy and
access to individuals of all ages and education levels. Policymakers and
educators can use these findings to design interventions that address the
unique needs of different demographic groups. For example, digital literacy programs can be developed and targeted to individuals with lower
education levels, and initiatives to promote physical activity and social
interaction can be developed to address the potential negative effects of
high levels of internet, video streaming, or video gaming use.

            <h3>3. Internet Access and Family Income
            </h3>
            <h4>1) Internet Access in Different Income Quartiles</h4>
            For the 2020 data, the lowest quartile is defined as less than or equal to
$52,203, the second quartile is from $52,204 to $92,485, the third quartile
is from $92,486 to $146,559, and the highest quartile is $146,560 or higher
(Statistics Canada, 2021). The graph shows the percentage of individuals
in different age groups and family income quartiles who access the internet
at various locations. The data highlights that the majority of people in all
income quartiles use the internet at home, with over 75% of individuals
in each quartile reporting this as a location for internet access. Additionally, the highest income quartile has a higher percentage of individuals
accessing the internet at work and at someone else’s home, while the lowest income quartile has a higher percentage of individuals accessing the
internet at a public library or another public location.


<h4>2) Policy Implications for Internet Access</h4>
This information can be useful for policymakers as it shows that efforts to
ensure equal access to the internet need to focus not only on affordability
and availability of services but also on ensuring access in public spaces,
such as libraries and community centers, which may be important for
individuals in lower income brackets who do not have access to the internet
at home or work. Policymakers can use this information to guide the
development of programs and policies aimed at increasing access to the
internet, especially for those in lower income quartiles.

              <h3>4. Smartphone Usage and Habits
              </h3>
              <h4>1) Policy Implications for Internet Access</h4>
              Below table provides important insights into how different age groups use
smartphones for personal use, as well as selected smartphone habits. One
key finding is that a vast majority of individuals aged 15 and over in
Canada have a smartphone for personal use, with the highest percentage
found in the 15 to 24-year-old age group at 96.3%. Additionally, the data
shows that individuals in younger age groups tend to use their smartphones
more frequently and in different contexts compared to older age groups.
For example, a higher percentage of individuals in the 15 to 24-year-old
age group check their smartphones at least every 30 minutes, use their
smartphones while watching television, and use their smartphones as the
first and last activity of the day.
  
  
  <h4>2) Implications for Healthy Smartphone Habits</h4>
  These findings have important implications for individuals, families, and
society as a whole. While smartphones can provide many benefits such as
staying connected with loved ones and accessing important information,
excessive use can also have negative effects on mental health, social interactions, and sleep patterns. Therefore, it is important for individuals and
families to be aware of their smartphone usage patterns and take steps to
minimize excessive use. This can include setting limits on phone usage,
establishing smartphone-free zones, and engaging in activities that do not
involve smartphones.
Policymakers and healthcare professionals can also use this information
to develop educational programs and interventions aimed at promoting
healthy smartphone habits among individuals of all ages. For example,
schools and community organizations can provide workshops on digital
literacy and responsible smartphone use, while healthcare professionals
can provide counseling and resources for individuals struggling with excessive smartphone use.

    <h2>Insights for Stakeholders</h2>
    <hr>
    <p class="text">
      <h3>1. For Policymakers
      </h3>
      One example of the real-world impact of our project can be seen in the identification of
rural areas with inadequate broadband connectivity. Our data visualization could be used
by policymakers to prioritize investment in broadband infrastructure in these underserved
areas, ultimately promoting economic growth and social inclusion. For instance, in 2019, the
Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) announced a $750
million fund to improve broadband access in rural and remote areas of Canada (CRTC, 2019).
By providing a comprehensive visualization of the current state of broadband connectivity in
the country, our project can help policymakers identify areas that require immediate attention
and allocate resources more efficiently.
Our data visualization can help policymakers identify specific regions where the digital divide is more prominent, enabling them to design targeted policies and initiatives to address
these gaps. For example, in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador, rural
areas have historically struggled with limited internet connectivity. Our project can help
policymakers in such provinces to better understand the disparities in access and quality,
allowing them to implement more effective solutions. A historic collaboration between the
Canadian Government and the Newfoundland and Labrador Government will invest up to
$136 million to connect all remaining rural households in Newfoundland and Labrador to
high-speed internet. The partnership aims to achieve the national target of connecting 98%
of Canadians by 2026 and 100% by 2030 (Government of Newfoundland Labrador, 2022).
<h3>2. For Internet Service Providers(ISPs)
</h3>
Our project’s impact extends to internet service providers (ISPs) who can use the insights
derived from our data visualization to strategically expand their networks and cater to regions
with high demand for improved connectivity. For example, Xplornet Communications Inc., a
rural broadband provider, has been working to improve internet access for Canadians living
in rural areas (Xplornet, 2023). Our project could aid ISPs like Xplornet in identifying
potential areas for expansion and better understanding the needs of their target customers.
Moreover, our project can help ISPs identify potential areas where collaboration with other
ISPs or public-private partnerships could be beneficial in expanding broadband infrastructure. For instance, the Connecting British Columbia program, funded by the provincial
government, encourages ISPs to collaborate on projects that improve internet access in underserved communities (Northern Development Initiative Trust, 2022). Our data visualization
can provide ISPs with valuable information about regions where such collaborative efforts
could have the most significant impact.

    <h2>Multidimentional Benefits</h2>
    <hr>
    <p class="text">
      <h3>1. Education
      </h3>The interactive web application developed in this project enables policymakers to visualize
      the disparities in internet access in different regions of Canada. This information can aid
      in making informed decisions for investments in broadband connectivity for underprivileged
      areas that have schools, which in turn will improve students’ access to online educational
      resources, e-learning platforms, and remote tutoring services.
      <h3>2. Healthcare
      </h3>
      The project’s data visualization helps identify areas with limited internet connectivity, which
can be critical in making decisions to improve telecommunication services in remote regions with people
 living in those areas. Enhancing internet connectivity in these areas will strengthen telehealth services, enabling healthcare providers to offer remote consultations,
 diagnoses, and monitoring for patients in far-flung communities.
 <h3>3. Economic Growth
</h3>
By analyzing the broadband data and highlighting regions with inadequate internet access,
this project can guide the government and ISPs in strategically investing in broadband infrastructure. Improved internet connectivity can improve economic development by attracting
new businesses, promoting entrepreneurship, and creating job opportunities in underdeveloped areas.
<h3>4. Emergency Services
</h3>
The project’s interactive web application showcases the areas with limited broadband connectivity, which can be crucial for planning improvements in communication networks for
emergency services. By enhancing internet access in these regions, emergency response times
can be reduced, and disaster management can be more effectively coordinated, ultimately
saving lives and property.
